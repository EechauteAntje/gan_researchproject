# Generate music with GAN

For school i made a GAN model that creates music. In this repository you can find out how i did that.

In the first folder 'easy_to_use' you can creat music directly. Follow the explainations in the readme file and the jupyter notebook.

I thhe second folder 'developing' you can train you own models, with the data u want. It is also explained in the readme and jupyter notebook.

Have fun!
